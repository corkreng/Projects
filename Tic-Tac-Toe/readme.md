This project was originally done in my senior year of my undergradaute studies in C++. It was then later imporved and translated into python. It uses the MiniMax algorithym so that the user can play agianst a computer. To do this copy and paste Tic.py into 
include reinforcement learning and monte carlo tree search.

It specifically references the MiniMax algorithm in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. 
  " Although this is a simple problem, it cannot readily be solved in a satisfactory way through classical techniques.
  For example, the classical “minimax” solution from game theory is not correct here because it assumes a particular
  way of playing by the opponent."
